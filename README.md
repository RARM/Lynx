# Lynx Client Project (Group 10)
If you're on the lookout for a top-notch digital distribution service storefront for video games - particularly indie games - then you needn't look any further than Lynx. Built with a priority on independent creators' works by providing an extensive array of titles, primarily targeted towards PC gamers or anyone interested in playing indie or third-party software. 

Lynx has four principal sections: The store section features tailored filters for users' personalized recommendations based on their liking, while allowing them to purchase new games at ease. The library section enables efficient organization and tracking owned content, alongside providing ample room for exploration. Community section allows users the ability to participate in forums, discussion groups or offer feedback directly designed by game creators who actively monitor it themselves. Last but not least, with user profile section makes customization and personalization truly accessible. 

Generating revenue purely from game sales and optional and purchasable cosmetics alone; Lynx refrains from overcrowding its platform by shunning advertisements or subscription services, which can sometimes spoil customer perception of the platform. It will be a native platform on only Windows PC; however, there are plans for potential expansion in due course, allowing other Operating Systems to be used to run Lynx. 

What sets Lynx apart is its emphasis on supporting game creators of all sizes and building communities around games and computer software. All donations made to game creators using fundraising features will go directly to them, with Lynx only profiting from cosmetics and a portion of game sales in the store. Lynxâ€™s primary goal will be to attract indie developers and fans of indie games by providing an easy-to-enter market with a wide array of features and promotional tools to efficiently market games to users from within the client.

Lynx, a platform that respects and supports both users and creators, fostering a loyal and happy community.
